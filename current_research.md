My master's thesis topic is focused on Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1). I am focusing on better understanding HTLV-1 associated myelopathy / tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). HAM/TSP is a disease that some HTLV-1 patients are at risk of developing. I will be using several omic data types on a admixed Brazilian population to better understand the mechanisms of HAM/TSP development and biomarkers for improving diagnosis and diagnosis. 

I am hoping to complete my master's thesis in June of 2023.
