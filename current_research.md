My master's thesis is focused on the application of polygenic risk scores (PRS) to HTLV-1 associated myelopathy / tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP, a painful neurodegenerative disease). Of the patients which are infected with Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) only around 5% have risk of development of HAM/TSP. The goal is to be able to use PRS to provide insight into describing the heritability in an admixed Brazilian cohort. A breadth of tools will be used for handling the admixture, relatedness between samples and PRS calculation. When performing PRS one needs an independent GWAS study and should be from the same ancestral background as the target sample. However, the only GWAS performed on HAM/TSP was in a Japanese cohort. Therefore, that will also have to be corrected for.

I am hoping to complete my master's thesis in June of 2023.
