## Early Life

I was born and raised in Colchester, Vermont. Being the youngest of three children and apart of a mixed family, having seven step siblings, I have a strong need for connection with others and my community. My youth was full of nature and inspiring role models. I spent many summers exploring the amazingly verdant environment around me and my school years at some of the amazing public schools offered in Vermont. I certainly learned to appreciate the small things in life from a young age and prefer to not surround myself with materialistic mindsets.

## High School Years

During my time in high school I participated in several activities: Student Government, Mathletes, Theatre and more. I also ran track and was the team captain of the cross country skiing team my senior year, leading us to place third place in the state that year.

Additionally, I petitioned my school board, along with the help of my French teacher, to allow for international field trips to promote cultural immersion. I was also the head and founder of my high school's International Club. The aim of this club was to have students share their experiences with traveling and current events. It was a safe space for non-American born students and refuge students, promoting cultural exchanges from all around the world.

Lastly, I gave the commencement speech at my high school graduation. This was my first time public speaking and to say the least it went amazingly. 

## Undergraduate Years

After spending most of my life in Colchester I did not travel very far for undergraduate. The University of Vermont, located in Burlington, was just a stones throw away and already somewhere I considered to be apart of my home. During my time there I was able to make several amazing connections with the community through activism and by contributing to the local economy as both an employee and consumer. 

I volunteered as a representative of my college, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, within my university. My role was to help students feel included and be a point person for any questions for perspective, current or graduated students. I was also lucky enough to be able to spend several weeks in Pokhara, Nepal as a volunteer. During the summer after my first year I went there to teach English to youth as it can heavily increase their chances of success globally. 

During my studies I tried to get a taste of biology, statistics and computer science to prepare me for a future in bioinformatics. My research experience can be seen on the "Past Research" page. I was happy to of made Dean's List several semesters during my studies.

I was also fortunate enough to do a semester abroad in Dortmund, Germany. Aside from it coinciding with the start of COVID it truly was an amazing experience that sparked a fire in me to keep traveling.

## Hobbies

In my free time I love to snowboard, cross country ski, practicing the synthesizer, hike, explore the nearby nature, travel and cook. I have been vegetarian for over 5 years now and recently have just got into repurposing clothing into new articles. I am a fan of electronic, indie and RnB. I could not have been enjoying my time as much as I have without acknowledging my amazing friends, family, pets and community in Vermont. 

I currently am living in Leuven, Belgium to continue studying. I am going for a masters in Bioinformatics. I am excited to continue exploring the world and myself simultaneously.
