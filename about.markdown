## Early Life

I was born and raised in Colchester, Vermont.  I spent many summers exploring the amazingly verdant environment around me. During my time in high school I participated in several activities: Student Government, Mathletes, Theatre and more. I also ran track and was the team captain of the cross country skiing team my senior year, leading us to place third place in the state that year. 


Additionally, I petitioned my school board, along with the help of my French teacher, to allow for international field trips to promote cultural immersion. I was also the head and founder of my high school's International Club. The aim of this club was to create a space for students of all different background to share their experiences and reflect on current events. 


## Undergraduate Years

After spending most of my life in Colchester I did not travel very far for undergraduate. The University of Vermont, located in Burlington, Vermont. During my time there I was able to make several amazing connections with the community through activism and by contributing to the local economy as both an employee and consumer. During my studies I worked a part time job waiting tables and bartending.

I volunteered as a representative of my college, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, within my university. My role was to help students feel included and be a point person for any questions for perspective, current or graduated students. I was also lucky enough to be able to spend several weeks in Pokhara, Nepal as a volunteer.

During my studies I tried to get a taste of biology, statistics and computer science to prepare me for a future in bioinformatics. My research experience can be seen on the "Past Research" page. I was happy to of made Dean's List several semesters during my studies.

I was also fortunate enough to do a semester abroad in Dortmund, Germany.

## Hobbies and Current

In my free time I love to snowboard, cross country ski, hike, explore the nearby nature, travel and cook. I currently am living in Leuven, Belgium to continue my studies in a Msc of Bioniformatics.
