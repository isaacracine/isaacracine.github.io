### Dr. Jeanne Harris

During my undergraduate years Jeanne was my advisor. She gave me insight that let me be so successful during  that time.

### Dr. Jill Preston

Jill was the PI of the first lab that I worked in. She gave me a lot of freedom, allowing me to learn from my mistakes. I am thrilled of all the wet bench experience I gained and her willingness to supervise a small bioinformatic research project.
