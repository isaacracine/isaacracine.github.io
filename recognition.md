This page is dedicated to the people who have helped me along the way. I could not be at the place I am today with out some honorable recognition of these wonderful people.



### Dr. Jeanne Harris

During my undergraduate years Jeanne was my advisor. To say the least she was the most helpful in informing me of all of the endless avenues I could go down in terms of my education. She gave me insight that let me be so successful during  that time. She also encouraged me to push myself in ways I never thought possible. Additionally, she was one to always be thinking of her advisees and students, sending me numerous research and course options year round.

### Dr. Jill Preston

Jill was a researcher that never gatekept knowledge or spaces in her research. I am forever thankful to of had the time I did learning underneath her supervision. She allowed me to do many experiments during my time and was never short when explaining something that was confusing for me. She was also amazing at guiding me through the research process without just giving me all of the answers. Someone who truly believes in the best in people and wants everyone to love plants just as much as she does. I can not stress enough how grateful I am for all the skills I learned under her guidance.

### Brittany Chase

When I was first learning to serve and later bar tend my manager at that time was non other than Ms. Brittany Chase. Herself was knew to the establishment and certainly believed that I could do more and more. She was a wonderful manager and I honestly could not of gotten so experienced in hospitality and food service without her genuine and caring guidance. I would not be as confident in myself as I am today with her encouraging words and positive attitude.
