# Undergraduate Research

During my undergraduate studies at the University of Vermont I conducted research under Dr. Jill Preston. Her lab studies grass development with genetic and cellular approaches. Here is a link to her lab's [website](https://jillpreston.weebly.com/) .

### Computational Experience

During my later half of working under Dr. Preston I conducted a self designed research project. The goal of my research was to see if there were any motifs within genes known to promote flowering after overwintering that were significantly different in grasses. This knowledge could be helpful in terms of understanding the evolutionary history that many norther grasses had undergone in which they required a certain amount of overwintering to promote spring growth.

After several months using data science, public algorithms and genetic databases there were several motifs found to be important in two of the most important genes (FUL1 and FUL2, also known as VRN1 and VRN2) for [vernalization](https://www.britannica.com/topic/vernalization) of grasses. The hopes of my research was to give results to Dr. Preston in which she could use in future experiments to test genetically modified organisms of different grass species. These GMOs could eventually allow for some grasses to not require as long of periods, if any, of vernalization. This is important as climate change continues to shorten the period of cold temperatures. Additionally, grasses provide the most amount of nutrients and food world wide. Thus, if a shortage of grass crops emerges due to warming temperatures it could be devastating to the global food security and result in severe famine. 



During this project I became very experienced using:

* Genome browsers (such as Phytozome)
  * Web scrapping
* Alignment software (MAAFT)
* Motif identifiers (such as MEME)
* Bayesian statistics (Mr. Bayes) 
* Biopython
* Building algorithms 
  * Used to differentiate the different regions of promoters, introns, exons, etc.

* Writing and reading scientific reports

  As a result this project was simultaneously used in a semester long research project for both Dr. Preston's lab and my data science course at that time.
